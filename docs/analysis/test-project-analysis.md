# Test Project Requirements Analysis

## Overview
The simple-test project was set up with basic functionality, but the agents were not given specific instructions to complete the 5 required tasks outlined in the README.md.

## Current State vs Requirements

### What Was Created (Initial Setup)
✅ **Basic HTTP server** - Responds with plain text "Hello from Simple Test App!"
✅ **Port 3000** - Hard-coded port
✅ **Basic startup logging** - Shows startup time and messages
✅ **Package.json** - With npm start script
✅ **README.md** - With clear task specifications

### What's Missing (Per Requirements)

#### Task 1: Add /status Endpoint ❌
**Required**: `/status` endpoint returning JSON with current time and server status
**Expected Response**: `{"status": "ok", "timestamp": "2025-09-11T17:30:00.000Z"}`
**Current State**: No /status endpoint exists

#### Task 2: Add Basic Error Handling ❌
**Required**: Error handling to prevent server crashes
**Current State**: No error handling implemented - server could crash on errors

#### Task 3: Create Simple HTML Response ❌
**Required**: Root path (/) should return simple HTML page instead of plain text
**Current State**: Returns plain text "Hello from Simple Test App!"

#### Task 4: Environment Variable Support ❌
**Required**: Port configurable via PORT environment variable (default 3000)
**Current State**: Hard-coded port 3000

#### Task 5: Request Logging ❌
**Required**: Request logging to show what endpoints are being hit
**Current State**: No request logging implemented

## Success Criteria Assessment

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Server starts without errors | ✅ | Basic server works |
| /status endpoint returns valid JSON | ❌ | Endpoint doesn't exist |
| Root path (/) returns simple HTML page | ❌ | Returns plain text |
| Port configurable via PORT environment variable | ❌ | Hard-coded to 3000 |
| Basic error handling prevents server crashes | ❌ | No error handling |
| Request logging shows activity | ❌ | No logging implemented |

**Current Success Rate: 1/6 (17%)**

## Required Implementation

The agents need to modify `/home/james/test-simple-project/app.js` to include:

1. **URL routing** to handle different endpoints (/, /status)
2. **Environment variable support** using `process.env.PORT || 3000`
3. **JSON response for /status** with current timestamp
4. **HTML response for root path** instead of plain text
5. **Request logging middleware** to log all incoming requests
6. **Error handling** with try-catch blocks and proper error responses

## Test Commands to Validate
```bash
# Start server
cd /home/james/test-simple-project
npm start

# Test endpoints (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:3000/              # Should return HTML
curl http://localhost:3000/status        # Should return JSON

# Test custom port
PORT=8080 npm start                       # Should use port 8080
```

## Agent Action Required
The Claude agent in session `simple-test:0` should be instructed to:
1. Review the current app.js file
2. Implement all 5 missing features
3. Test the implementation
4. Verify all success criteria are met

## Priority: HIGH
This is a test of the orchestrator's ability to complete specific, well-defined tasks. The current 17% completion rate indicates the agent either:
- Wasn't given clear instructions about the specific tasks
- Wasn't directed to read and follow the README.md requirements
- Needs more explicit task breakdown and validation steps

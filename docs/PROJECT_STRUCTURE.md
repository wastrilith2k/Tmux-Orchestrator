# Tmux Orchestrator - Complete Project Structure Documentation

**Date Created**: September 16, 2025
**Version**: 2.0
**Architecture**: Multi-Agent AI Orchestration System with Full Containerization

## üéØ Project Overview

The Tmux Orchestrator is a sophisticated **autonomous multi-agent AI development system** where Claude agents coordinate development work through both traditional tmux sessions and containerized environments. The system supports persistent work sessions that continue even when disconnected, with agents that can:

- Autonomously develop, test, and deploy applications
- Coordinate with other agents via structured communication
- Self-schedule work and maintain development momentum
- Operate in both host-based (tmux) and containerized (Docker) environments

## üîó System Architecture Patterns

### Communication Flow
```
Orchestrator (Coordination)
    ‚ÜïÔ∏è (tmux/Redis messaging)
Project Manager (Quality)
    ‚ÜïÔ∏è (structured protocols)
Engineers/Specialists (Implementation)
```

### Deployment Options

#### 1. **Host-Based Deployment**
- Uses traditional tmux sessions
- Direct shell script communication via `send-claude-message.sh`
- Persistent sessions survive disconnection
- Full shell environment access

#### 2. **Containerized Deployment**
- Docker containers for each agent
- Redis pub/sub communication
- Isolated execution environments
- Scalable infrastructure with PostgreSQL and Redis

### Critical Workflow Patterns

#### Agent Communication Protocol
```bash
# ALWAYS use the dedicated script - never manual tmux commands
./bin/send-claude-message.sh session:window "message content"
```

#### Self-Scheduling Pattern
```bash
# Agents schedule their own check-ins
./bin/schedule_with_note.sh 30 "Continue feature implementation" "session:window"
```

#### Git Safety Rules (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Every agent must commit every 30 minutes
git add -A
git commit -m "Progress: specific description of work done"
```

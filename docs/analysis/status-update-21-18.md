# Test Project Status Update

**Time**: 21:18 PDT, September 11, 2025

## Issue Resolution: âœ… RESOLVED

### Problem Identified
- **Not rate limiting**: Messages were being delivered successfully
- **Workflow blockage**: Agent was stuck on a permission dialog from the scheduled check
- **User interaction needed**: Dialog required user input before agent could proceed

### Solution Applied
1. **Clear guidance provided**: Sent specific instructions to dismiss dialog
2. **Priority focus**: Directed agent to focus on main task (app.js implementation)
3. **Workflow unblocked**: Agent successfully dismissed dialog and began work

## Current Agent Status: ðŸŸ¢ ACTIVE

### Progress Observed
- âœ… **Dialog dismissed**: Agent pressed '3' to clear permission dialog
- âœ… **Requirements reading**: Currently reading README.md (36 lines)
- âœ… **Task understanding**: Shows "Next: Edit app.js to add missing features"
- âœ… **Following instructions**: Agent is working through priority list as directed

### Agent Activity Log
```
20:48:22 - Task message delivered
21:18:18 - Workflow guidance sent
21:18:19 - Agent responded and dismissed dialog
21:18:xx - Agent reading README.md
21:18:xx - Planning to edit app.js next
```

## Next Expected Actions
1. **Complete README analysis**: Understand all 5 required tasks
2. **Edit app.js**: Implement missing features
3. **Test implementation**: Verify functionality works
4. **Report completion**: Confirm all success criteria met

## Monitoring Plan
- Continue checking agent progress every few minutes
- Validate implementation once agent reports completion
- Document lessons learned about workflow management

## Key Learning
**The issue was workflow management, not rate limiting.** The orchestrator's scheduled checks can sometimes create blocking dialogs that prevent agents from processing new tasks. In future, we should:
- Consider agent state before sending scheduled checks
- Provide clearer guidance on handling interruptions
- Design better workflow coordination patterns

**Status**: Agent is now actively working on the implementation tasks. âœ…

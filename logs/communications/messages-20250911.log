[2025-09-11 20:48:21] SENDING to simple-test:0: URGENT: Requirements Review & Task Completion Needed

I've analyzed the test project and found that only 1 out of 6 success criteria have been met (17% completion). Please immediately:

1. READ the README.md file in /home/james/test-simple-project/README.md to understand ALL 5 required tasks
2. REVIEW the current app.js file to see what's missing
3. IMPLEMENT the missing features:
   - Add /status endpoint returning JSON: {"status": "ok", "timestamp": "ISO-date"}
   - Add HTML response for root path (/) instead of plain text
   - Add PORT environment variable support (process.env.PORT || 3000)
   - Add basic error handling to prevent crashes
   - Add request logging for all endpoints

4. TEST each feature using the commands in README.md
5. VERIFY all 6 success criteria are met

This is a critical test of our orchestrator system. Please complete ALL tasks and confirm when done.

Then navigate to the project directory and start working on the app.js file. Here's your priority list: 1) Read README.md 2) Edit app.js to add missing features 3) Test your implementation. Do NOT get distracted by other tasks until the 5 features are complete.

Project: python-ml-pipeline
Type: python
Path: /home/james/test-projects/ml-pipeline
Description: Machine learning data processing pipeline

📋 YOUR MISSION:
1. Analyze the existing project structure in /home/james/test-projects/ml-pipeline
2. Set up the development environment:
   - For Node.js projects: Run 'npm install' if package.json exists
   - For Python projects: Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' if requirements.txt exists
   - Create virtual environments as needed
3. Start the development server (npm run dev, uvicorn, etc.)
4. Begin implementing features based on the project type
5. Commit progress every 30 minutes with meaningful messages
6. Use ./send-claude-message.sh to report status updates
7. Schedule check-ins with ./schedule_with_note.sh

🤖 AUTONOMOUS OPERATION:
- Work independently without waiting for instructions
- Make reasonable development decisions based on project type
- If stuck for >2 minutes, ask specific questions
- Focus on creating a working, deployable application

⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- git commit -am "progress update" every 30 minutes
- Send status updates every hour using ./send-claude-message.sh
- Never wait idle - always be developing or improving

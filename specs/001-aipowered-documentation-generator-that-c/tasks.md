# Tasks: 001 Aipowered Documentation Generator That C

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-aipowered-documentation-generator-that-c/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load supporting documents: research.md, contracts
3. Generate tasks by category: Setup → Tests → Core → Integration → Polish
4. Apply task rules: Different files = [P], Same file = sequential
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Create dependency graph and parallel execution examples
7. Validate task completeness
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize project with dependencies from research.md
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure development environment and tools

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
- [ ] T004 [P] Create unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] T005 [P] Create integration tests for main workflows
- [ ] T006 [P] Create end-to-end tests for user scenarios

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

- [ ] T011 Implement core data models and entities
- [ ] T012 [P] Implement business logic and service layer
- [ ] T013 [P] Implement API endpoints or interfaces
- [ ] T014 [P] Implement user interface components
- [ ] T015 Implement main workflow coordination
- [ ] T016 [P] Implement validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 [P] Implement data persistence layer


## Phase 3.4: Integration

- [ ] T018 Integrate all components and test system workflows
- [ ] T019 [P] Configure deployment and environment setup


## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T020 [P] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] T021 [P] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] T022 [P] Add performance optimizations
- [ ] T023 [P] Create documentation and examples

## Dependencies
- Tests (T004-T010) before implementation (T011-T017)
- Setup tasks (T001-T003) before all others
- Integration tasks (T018-T019) after core implementation

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T004-T006 together (different test files):
Task: "Create unit tests for core entities in tests/unit/test_entities.py"
Task: "Create integration tests for API endpoints in tests/integration/test_api.py"
Task: "Create contract tests for external services in tests/contract/test_external.py"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

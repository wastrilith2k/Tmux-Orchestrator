# Implementation Plan: 001-aipowered-documentation-generator-that-c

**Branch**: `001-aipowered-documentation-generator-that-c` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification + Technical details: "Python FastAPI service with tree-sitter for code parsing, OpenAI for content generation, filesystem integration for README creation"

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Read feature specification requirements
2. Apply technical constraints: Python FastAPI service with tree-sitter for code parsing, OpenAI for content generation, filesystem integration for README creation
3. Generate project structure
4. Create Phase 0: Research
5. Create Phase 1: Design & Contracts
6. Document task planning approach for /tasks command
7. Return: SUCCESS (ready for /tasks)
```

## Summary

This implementation plan translates the feature specification into a concrete technical approach using:
- Python FastAPI service with tree-sitter for code parsing, OpenAI for content generation, filesystem ...

## Technical Context

### Technology Stack

### Primary Technologies
Python FastAPI service with tree-sitter for code parsing, OpenAI for content generation, filesystem integration for README creation

### Development Tools
- Testing framework for unit and integration tests
- Linting and code formatting tools
- Build and deployment automation


### Architecture Decisions

### Key Decisions
1. **Technology Choice**: Python FastAPI service with tree-sitter for code p...
2. **Testing Strategy**: Test-driven development with comprehensive coverage
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive logging
4. **Code Organization**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns

```

## Phase 0: Research & Setup

### Technology Research
- Evaluate Python FastAPI service for this use case
- Identify required dependencies and tools
- Research best practices and patterns

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### API Design (if applicable)
- Define REST endpoints or communication interfaces
- Document request/response schemas
- Create contract tests

### Data Model Design (if applicable)
- Identify core entities and relationships
- Define data persistence strategy
- Plan migration approach

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load templates/tasks-template.md as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan
